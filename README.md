Car Dealership project

This was originally a class project for The Software Guild.  I decided to start over from scratch and play around with different things.

Some features:

1) Use of Google Maps API on Contact page
2) Two Factor authenication using Twilio to send text messages
3) Bootstrap 4 using MDBootstrap (theme based on Google's Material         Design).
4) Entity Framework 6
5)
